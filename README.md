# Research_Management_System
Research Management System for my Application Framework Module project

We developed a web application project for research project management. In this project, we
used this technology stack to build the project. ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, JSON-based Web
Services, MongoDB for Database, JEST for testing, and Heroku for Cloud hosting.
This report aims to present the audience with a realistic overview of our project and demonstrate
how our team members contribute to it. Our entire team detailed their functions one by one, gave
an idea about their work, and included screenshots, code Snippets for both the frontend and
backend and Screenshots of mongo DB Schemas for Methodology in this report. We also include
an introduction and a conclusion in this report.
