# Research_Management_System
Research Management System for my Application Framework Module project

We developed a web application project for research project management. In this project, we
used this technology stack to build the project. ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, JSON-based Web
Services, MongoDB for Database, JEST for testing, and Heroku for Cloud hosting.
This report aims to present the audience with a realistic overview of our project and demonstrate
how our team members contribute to it. Our entire team detailed their functions one by one, gave
an idea about their work, and included screenshots, code Snippets for both the frontend and
backend and Screenshots of mongo DB Schemas for Methodology in this report. We also include
an introduction and a conclusion in this report.

# Student_Management (my part)

*First, the student needs to create a research group. The student can add group members to the research group. The group creator can assign a group leader for the research group. After group creation is a success, he/she must find a research topic in a specific research field. The next step is finding a supervisor and co-supervisor. For that, he/she can click the supervisor button. The student needs to select a research field in the given drop-down box. Now, the system will display the supervisor's list in the selected field. Enter a research topic and message. He/she can request that supervisor. Once the supervisor accepts the topic, they must find a cosupervisor of the same research interest. For that, he/she can click the co-supervisor button. The student needs to select a research field in the given drop-down box. Now, the system will display the co-supervisor's list in the selected field. Enter a research topic and message. He/she can request that co-supervisor. After finalizing, the supervisor's student must register their research topic. For that, they need to provide some references, some already published documents, and the topic details of the research. After accepting the topic, they can continue to do the research project. If rejected, 7 they must find a new topic and submit it back. They must submit a proposal, report, presentation, and final thesis during the project
